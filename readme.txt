== Description ==

IE6 Upgrade Option utilizes the 7.9kb script created by mihai.ile: http://code.google.com/p/ie6-upgrade-warning/ as a WordPress plugin. I preferred this script over the many alternatives due to the fact that the message is displayed with a Lightbox effect and not placed at the top of the code forcing content down and drastically altering the page appearance. This plugin displays a warning message, simply and politely informing the user that their browser is out of date and providing links to download newer browsers. Links included are: IE8, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Chrome. 

The web page remiains visible through a transparent, Lightbox effect in the background and the user has the option of closing the window agreeing that their experience may be severely degraded. The javascript then installs a cookie preventing the window from appearing again, unless the cookies are cleared. The script is added to the footer of the HTML only if the browser is detected as being an MSIE browser, notably Internet Explorer 6.
